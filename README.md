## Before You Start

SalonMate is a mobile application that allows users to discover hair salons in their city and district, book appointments and evaluate their services. Users can make appointments with hair salons for the day and time they want, get service with their preferred stylist and manage their appointments. They can also view the nearest hair salons on the app via a map and review their location information.
SalonMate offers an innovative platform that digitalizes the hair salon experience with its user-friendly interface, secure session management and advanced notification infrastructure.
